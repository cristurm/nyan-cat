Nyan Cat
========

[DEMO HERE](http://cristurm.github.io/nyan-cat/)

Nyan Cat made with HTML5+CSS3 (and JavaScript :T).

Goals:
------

1. My main goal with this project is to recreate the Nyan Cat we love using nothing but HTML and CSS3 (HTML5 audio for the background music).
~~2. JavaScript is used with jQuery lib mainly to cycle element classes and duplicate some stuff in order to cover the entire screen.~~ (-not anymore)
3. Must be responsive.
4. Must look exactly like the original Nyan Cat.

To Do List:
-----------

- [x] Fix rainow glitch on various resolutions
- [x] Add song (with loop)
- [ ] Improve Performance
- [ ] Find a way to verticaly replicate sparks without using JS
- [x] Remove JS Sparks Combos (repeat and left movement)
- [x] Remove JS Sparks
- [x] Remove JS Rainbow
- [ ] Remove JS Nyan Cat
- [ ] Add parallax effect to the sparks (this will be awesome! :D)
